               Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ephantus & am a Software Engineer {}  

As a Software Engineer, I work on web applications, systems development, and web
infrastructure. I have been developing professionally for over 3 years but tinkering since a kid. But I don't want
just " you to know that "... I want the " whole world to know that! ".
I started in tech with internships, freelance services, and part-time positions during campus.
I have a bit of a diverse job history. I have had some partial positions in help desk, graphics/web design, web
app development, and sysadmin/DevOps. I can help everywhere in the stack. Let's say that I love wearing
multiple hats to an extent, well they say "You never know what's coming...".
Although my strongest skills are in software engineering and system security, I can work on any similar field or
close.
A day in my life may consist of: prepping web art, fixing some front-end/back-end bugs, app development, and
systems developing and setting up a build or deployment plan and tests when I am lucky.

My Major Skills Are:

    PYTHON | NODE | | EXPRESS | REACT{ [js/html/css] } | MongoDB | | Axios | |Redux| |GraphQL| | UX/UI Design

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on API's
