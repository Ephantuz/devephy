### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ephantus from Kenya, Africa and am a software engineer. I design and develop web applications as well as desktop aplications. I have focused myself more into Python (back-end) and React (Front-end) languages but am also good with Java(back-end).

I have more than 3 years of experience and this is where you will see what i've been doing, from web projects to applications projects. I love what I do and this is my hobby too.When am free, I code.
