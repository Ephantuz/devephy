Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ephantus & am a Software Engineer

I'm Ephantus from Kenya, Africa, and am a software engineer. I design and develop web applications as well as desktop applications. I have focused more on Python (back-end) and React (Front-end) languages but am also good with Java(back-end).

I have more than 3 years of experience and this is where you will see what I've been doing, from web projects to applications projects. I love what I do and this is my hobby too. When am free, I code.

Skills: PYTHON / JAVA / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on API's
