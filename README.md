  I have a lot of stuffs to talk about but I Decided to just show you instead What it entails. But before that, let me do my dramatic introduction. This is my GitHub profile and here, itâ€™s where you will find what my world involves and by that, I mean My projects. ðŸ˜Š

 Ephantus, yep! Thatâ€™s my name on this worldâ€¦ And am an Engineer, A software Engineer to be precise. I know itâ€™s Title, but I own it here based on my art and wonders I can do. Here, I believe am a mastermind of my art and best of my best.  After my senior/high school, I ventured myself into development of softwares and became curious of how systems are designed and developed. How data is kept and retrieved from space, Cloud itâ€™s the name ðŸ˜Š.  I was tinkering in between the development process and it took me 3 good years to understand everything I needed.

We speak of what one can do here, and me, I develop things from scratch. A Breed hard to find I believe. Iâ€™ve mastered my languages and decided what I want. I create systems. Both web Applications to systems applications. I deal with backend (Processing of data), APIs (data flow back to front) to Frond-End (UI and user/customer interface).
 Iâ€™ve also mastered databases, as well as cloud. From Mongo dB Database to AWS server. I started in tech with internships, freelance services, and part-time positions during campus. I have a bit of a diverse job history. I have had some partial positions in help desk, graphics/web design, webapp development, and sysadmin/DevOps. I can help everywhere in the stack. Let's say that I love wearing multiple hats to an extent, well they say â€œYou never know what's coming... "Although my strongest skills are in software engineering and system security, I can work on any similar field or close. A day in my life may consist of: prepping web art, fixing some front-end/back-end bugs, app development, and systems developing and setting up a build or deployment plan and tests when I am lucky.
